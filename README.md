# Vue Learning Projects

This repository contains various Vue projects that I am building to learn and practice Vue.js. Each project is organized in its own folder and uses Vite for fast development and bundling.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESLint & Prettier** - Code linting and formatting
- **JSON Server** - Mock API for testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running a Project

Navigate to the specific project folder and start the development server:
```sh
cd project-folder
npm run dev
```
This will launch the Vite development server and you can access the app at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`** - Start the development server
- **`npm run build`** - Build the project for production
- **`npm run preview`** - Preview the built project
- **`npm run lint`** - Run ESLint to check for code issues
- **`npm run format`** - Format code using Prettier
- **`npm run server`** - Start JSON Server with a mock API (runs on port 3001)

## Project Structure
Each project follows a standard Vue project structure:
```
repo-root/
  â”œâ”€â”€ project-1/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ project-2/
  â”œâ”€â”€ project-3/
  â”œâ”€â”€ ...
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
  â””â”€â”€ package.json
```
